## Overview

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Search for a Github Profile and viewe the profiles generate stats
- User will be advised if no profile is found for the specific user searched.
- User can toggle between light and dark mode
